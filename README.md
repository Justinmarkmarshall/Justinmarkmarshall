Hi, I’m @Justinmarkmarshall
I’m interested in modern web development like .NET Core, Micro services, SPAs and ML.
I’m currently learning .NET, C#, SQL, modern js frameworks like Vue.js, Data Structures and Algorithms, and some Machine Learning and Mathematics.
I’m looking to collaborate on all of the above!
